Body:

Hi my name is Mix, you put your hand up to help welcome + weave folks at Dweb and I'm here to help guide you in that process.

What you need to know:
1. Onboarding/ Training (choose one)
    - A. Online:
       - I'll run 2 calls, help me choose times HERE
       - stay tuned!
    - B. In person: At camp

    - questions welcome, this is an evolving doc


Ask:
I'd love 5-10 more weavers (we have 24 currently = 7 people per weaver group. I want redundancy so we can welcome more people AND keep groups cosy).
If you know someone who loves supporting communities to grow, please connect me (ﾉ´ヮ´)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
