# Weaving Groups

Some people have been coming to Dweb Camp for years, know the culture, the
patterns, have a crew. If you're new this can be hard to approach. Weaving
groups are offered as an approachable point of contact.

## Process

We form small groups on the first day, made up of:
- a weaver: someone with knowledge/ experience to host + guide the group
- old hands: 1 or more people who've been to dweb before
- new folks: it's your first time!

We meet for a short time at the end of each day to connect, share highlights,
reflect a little.

    - small groups: many people find large groups intimidating, so meeting in
    small groups is a way to make a cosier more personable space.
    - old hands: having a people who've been before means rather than reading
    some manual, you can ask questions directly of a person who can share their
    experience. They also likely know where to find things / people if they
    can't answer a specific question

## What to discuss in Weaving Groups

What each group discusses will vary based on participants. The guiding
principle is that weaving is there to help people arrive.

That can take many forms:
- getting to know a little more about a few people in the camp
- the chance to share something and be heard
- sparking curiosity through peeks into others experience
- a group you can ask questions of to help wayfind

The first time you meet is a great time to share your name and some context
about where you're from. It could be a "round" where each person answers 3
questions:
1. where did you travel here from?
2. what's something you're passionate about / love to do?
3. what's your name?


### Mix's recipe

I run weaving circles fairly simply with these phases:
- business: "does anyone have any questions / need help with anything?"
- simple round: "what is one thing you loved from today?"
    - a "round" is where each person gets to speak (~2 mins each)
    - allow minimal curious questions, but gently keep it moving
- pick a path: "the structured part is done, we have X mins till dinner, how
  would you like to spend it?"
    - a) open conversation about something someone raised
    - b) pair walks: pair up with someone, go for a 15 min walk and just talk,
      once you're done just head off to dinner / whatever
    - c) discuss what you're looking fwd to tmrw
- close: "we're X mins before dinner, I'd like to draw us to a close"
    - I like a clear close, otherwise the energy / focus tapers off, people
      drift off, and it can get weird :P
    - people can hang around and continue to talk of course!
    - reminder of time + place

## FAQ - Participants

1. **Are weaving groups just for new people?**
- No! If you're an "old hand" there is a lot you can both offer AND gain from
  participating:
    - extending the culture that you would like to see prosper
    - sharing knowledge / experience
    - meeting new people / ideas (break out of your silo!)

2. **Are weaving groups compulsory?**
- No. Highly recommended, and optional.
- If you do join a weaving group, please commit to coming each night, it saves
  groups re-organising and waiting in case people do / don't show up.

## FAQ - Weavers

1. **I don't know everything, what if someone asks a question I don't know how
to answer?**
- Totally normal. You can say you don't know and but that you can help find the
  right person to ask
- You might also ask the group - there's a decent chance there's another
  participant who knows.



## History

Weaving is a pattern which was adopted from the Enspiral community (via
Scuttlebutt), where there has been a history of yearly gatherings. In that
context it was called "home groups".

In the Dweb context weaving has been run for several camps, and it's been an
opt-in process.
